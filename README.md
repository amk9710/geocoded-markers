# geocoded-markers
This is the first step in my map development for my final project. Ultimately I want to create an interactive map for business owners to understand how many vehicle miles their products travel in their life cycle. For example, a brewery could enter the location of their source ingredients, their brewing location, and distribution sites to visualize the full distance their product travels in its life cycle.
